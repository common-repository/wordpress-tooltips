Responsive Wordpress Tooltips:
Tooltips are small popup boxes that display additional information such as text, video, audio, images, Google Maps, QR codes, links, Wikipedia, Youtube, Soundcloud, PDFs, GIFs, SVGs...and more. These tooltips will appear when users hover over an element on your pages. The element could be a word in your post, an image on your page, post title, post tag, a search form input box, a word in a menu item, a widget in your sidebar, a label in a contact form, a word in a WooCommerce description or WooCommerce additional information tab, ACF tooltips, a word in a comment, fields in a pricing table, WordPress buttons, or multimedia content for an image or gallery... and so on.

When a user hovers over an item with the pointer, a tooltip box will appear. You can add text, images, videos, radio buttons, audio players, social links, and more to the tooltip box. Tooltips can be added to various elements such as post titles, post content, post excerpts, post tags, WordPress archives, WordPress menu items, galleries, and so on.
WordPress Tooltip also supports a glossary feature - simply insert the shortcode [glossary] in any page or post. A screenshot can be found at this link -- https://ps.w.org/wordpress-tooltips/assets/screenshot-6.png.

WordPress Tooltip is a simple, quick, lightweight, and powerful jQuery tooltip solution that is very user-friendly. You can easily add any HTML content using the standard WordPress WYSIWYG editor. For example, you can add a PDF, video player, audio player, image, social link, payment QR code, and more.

You can easily and quickly manage all tooltip keywords and content centrally in one admin panel. Simply input the keyword in the title field and the video/radio/text/image/links in the WordPress Tooltip WYSIWYG editor. The WordPress Tooltip plugin will detect your tooltip keywords in the frontend elements such as post content, post title, post tags, menu item... and more, and automatically apply the tooltip effect to the tooltip terms.

In general, you do not need a tooltip shortcode because the WordPress Tooltips plugin will automatically add tooltip effects for tooltip terms. However, you can use tooltip and glossary shortcodes like this:
Shortcode [tooltips]:

[tooltips keyword="wordpress tooltips" content="WordPress Tooltips is a rich-featured WordPress tooltip plugin."]
or
[tooltips content="WordPress Tooltips is a rich-featured WordPress tooltip plugin"]wordpress tooltips[/tooltips]

Shortcode [tooltip_by_id]:
[tooltip_by_id tooltip_id='222']
'222' is the post ID of the tooltip, which you can find in the WYSIWYG tooltips editor. Using this method, you can edit multimedia content in the WordPress Tooltip WYSIWYG editor, and insert tooltip effects with multimedia into the page builder (Gutenberg, Elementor, Beaver, Visual Composer...), WordPress posts, or other compatible plugins (WooCommerce, WPForms...) through the [tooltip_by_id] shortcode.

Shortcode [glossary] and [tooltiplist] -- you can insert these shortcode into any wordpress post to build a glossary quickly 

For more details, please check <a href='https://tooltips.org/how-to-use-wordpress-tooltip-shortcode-tooltips-to-add-tooltips-manually/' target='blank'>document of wordpress tooltip shortcode</a> 

For gallery users, such as NextGen, you do not need to do anything. Our WordPress Tooltip plugin will automatically detect the NextGen descriptions and display them as tooltips when users hover over the NextGen gallery images. Additionally, our plugin supports many other gallery/slideshow plugins. You can configure tooltip management options in the Tooltips Global Settings panel.

WordPress Tooltips also support many other amazing plugins. Users have told us that they are adding WordPress Tooltip effects to Elementor page builder, TablePress, WPForms, pricing table, Contact Form 7, WooCommerce, ACF tooltip... and more :)
